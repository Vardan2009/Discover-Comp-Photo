    "# Bonus Challenge for OpenCV\n",

    "Here is a small challenge using OpenCV.\n",

    "Your task: Create an Andy Warhol-inspired image: \n",

    "\n",
    "Andy Warhol is an American artist known for his paintings that consist of repeated comic-style images. We have an example of one of his paintings above. Your challenge is to use the OpenCV skills you've learned to emulate one of his paintings using an image of your choice. This challenge works well with images that have flat or empty backgrounds. Your Andy Warhol image should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contain at least 4 repeated images stacked together in a single image\n",
    "* Each repeated image should have unique colors\n",
    "* The colors in the image should be *flattened* in a way to emulate comic-styles. This means that there should be only around 4-6 unique colors in each image patch, and colors should be mapped to one of these colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've split up this challenge into multiple pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful Resources**:\n",
    "* Numpy hstack and vstack functions\n",
    "* https://wamingo.net/rgbbgr/ for finding colors\n",
    "* https://imagecolorpicker.com/ for picking colors from your image"
